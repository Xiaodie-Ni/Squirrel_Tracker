# Squirrel Tracker
## What is it?

This is a Django based final project for Tools for Analytics by Group 24. Our web keeps track of squirrels from Central Park. Data is obtained from [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

## Main Features

Here are some features:

+ An admin command that imports data from the 2018 census file.
+ An admin command that exports data in CSV format.
+ A map that displays a maximum of 100 unique squirrel sighting coordinates at a time, supported by OpenStreets map.
+ A list of all viewable sightings which you can click to see details.
+ Functions that allow you to update existing sightings or create new ones that you have found. The database will change accordingly after edits.
+ General statistics analyzing five attributes of the squirrel sighting dataset.
